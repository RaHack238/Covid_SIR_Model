# Covid_SIR_Model
SIR Model for South Carolina, USA

  
Hi Guys!

I developed this project as my assignment for BIO101 course which was based on the SIR Model to fit the COVID data for South Carolina

We used the dataset from the below link
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us
(till 21st June 2020)

- We then refined the dataset using Microsoft Excel and the final dataset is as in the folder Datasets (GithubData.csv)
- We have indented and commented the code which would make it easy for you guys to understand it
- However, if you have any doubts and know me, you can contact me for clarification :)
- Kindly raise any issues if you find any error or want to improve and we would be more than happy to help :p
